<p>Once you get the trick, it is easy to extent to most Functor.</p>
<pre><code>type Tree = Mu TreeF
data TreeF x = Node Int [x]

instance Functor TreeF where
  fmap f (Node e xs) = Node e (fmap f xs)

depth = cata phi where
  phi :: Algebra TreeF Int -- TreeF Int -&gt; Int
  phi (Node x sons) = 1 + foldr max 0 sons</code></pre>
